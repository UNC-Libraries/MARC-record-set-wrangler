MARC files produced by the script as it is working are put in this folder.

These files contain one record per file, and are only produced if you are processing with files in the data/existing_marc directory.

These files are deleted by the script when it completes successfully. If the script crashes, you may find a lot of files in this folder. It is COMPLETELY SAFE to manually delete these files.
